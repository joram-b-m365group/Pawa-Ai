## 🔥 Expected Results:

### Before (50 examples):
```
User: "What is biology?"
AI: "This is an interesting topic! Here's what I understand about it.
     When you ask about this, you're touching on something that connects
     to broader ideas and principles..."
```
**Rating:** ⭐ Useless generic filler

### After (100k OpenOrca examples):
```
User: "What is biology?"
AI: "Biology is the scientific study of life and living organisms,
     encompassing everything from the molecular mechanisms within cells
     to entire ecosystems. It's divided into several major branches:

     - Molecular Biology: Studies life at the molecular level (DNA, proteins)
     - Cellular Biology: Focuses on cell structure and function
     - Genetics: Examines heredity and genetic variation
     - Evolution: Explores how species change over time
     - Ecology: Studies organism-environment interactions
     - Physiology: Investigates how living systems function

     Biology is fundamental to understanding health, disease, biodiversity,
     conservation, and our place in the natural world. It combines observation,
     experimentation, and theory to explain the complexity of life."
```
**Rating:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ GENIUS-LEVEL!

## 📞 Need Help?

### Common Issues:

**"No GPU available"**
- Go to Runtime > Change runtime type > Select GPU
- Try again in a few hours if quota exceeded

**"Out of memory"**
- The notebook auto-adjusts batch size
- Should work on any free GPU
- If still fails, reduce MAX_EXAMPLES to 50000

**"Training stopped"**
- Check if Colab disconnected (90 min idle timeout)
- Click "Reconnect" and resume from last checkpoint
- Next time, keep tab active

**"Download is slow"**
- Model ZIP is ~330 MB - takes 5-10 minutes
- Be patient, it's worth it!
