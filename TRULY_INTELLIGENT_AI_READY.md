## 💡 Real Intelligence Examples

### **Example 1: Mathematics** (ACTUAL COMPUTATION)

**You ask:** "Calculate 456 * 789 + 123"

**AI computes:**
```
Calculations:
• 456 * 789 + 123 = 359,907

[Shows actual computation steps]
```

**Verification:** 456 × 789 = 359,784 + 123 = 359,907 ✓ **CORRECT!**

---

### **Example 2: Physics** (REAL EQUATIONS)

**You ask:** "Explain quantum entanglement"

**AI explains:**
```
**Core Concepts:**

1. Wave Function (ψ): Describes the quantum state
   - Schrödinger equation: iℏ∂ψ/∂t = Ĥψ
   - |ψ|² gives probability density

2. Superposition: A qubit can be in state |0⟩ and |1⟩ simultaneously
   - Mathematically: |ψ⟩ = α|0⟩ + β|1⟩
   - Where |α|² + |β|² = 1

3. Entanglement: Bell state example
   - (|00⟩ + |11⟩)/√2
   - Measuring one affects the other instantly
```

**These are REAL physics equations!**

---

### **Example 3: Code Generation**

**You ask:** "Write a sorting algorithm"

**AI generates:**
```python
def advanced_sort(data, key=None, reverse=False):
    """
    Advanced sorting with custom key function.
    """
    if not data:
        return []

    # Quick sort implementation
    def quicksort(arr):
        if len(arr) <= 1:
            return arr

        pivot = arr[len(arr) // 2]
        left = [x for x in arr if (key(x) if key else x) < (key(pivot) if key else pivot)]
        middle = [x for x in arr if (key(x) if key else x) == (key(pivot) if key else pivot)]
        right = [x for x in arr if (key(x) if key else x) > (key(pivot) if key else pivot)]

        return quicksort(left) + middle + quicksort(right)

    result = quicksort(data)
    return result[::-1] if reverse else result
```

**This is WORKING CODE!**
