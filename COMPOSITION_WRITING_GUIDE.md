# 📖 Types of Compositions

## 1. Narrative Composition (Story)

**Purpose:** Tell a story (real or fictional)

**Structure:**
1. **Exposition** - Introduce characters, setting
2. **Rising Action** - Build tension, develop conflict
3. **Climax** - Highest point of tension
4. **Falling Action** - Events after climax
5. **Resolution** - Conclusion, problems solved

### Narrative Example: "A Lesson Learned"

**Introduction:**
> The autumn wind whistled through the trees as I stood outside the principal's office, my heart pounding. I had never been in trouble before, and the weight of my mistake pressed heavily on my shoulders.

**Body (Rising Action):**
> It had started as a simple joke. My friend dared me to copy the homework answers, and foolishly, I accepted. "Everyone does it," he had said, and at the time, it seemed harmless. I carefully transcribed the answers, changed a few words to make it less obvious, and submitted the work as my own.
>
> Days passed without incident. I began to relax, thinking I had gotten away with it. But then Mrs. Johnson asked me to stay after class. She placed both papers side by side on her desk, and my stomach dropped. The similarities were undeniable.

**Climax:**
> "I'm disappointed," she said quietly, and those words hurt more than any punishment could. I wanted to explain, to justify my actions, but the words caught in my throat. I had betrayed her trust, and no excuse could change that.

**Falling Action:**
> The consequences were severe: a zero on the assignment, detention for a week, and a call to my parents. But the real punishment was facing my own reflection, knowing I had compromised my integrity for a grade.

**Conclusion:**
> That experience taught me that shortcuts often lead to dead ends. Integrity isn't about what you do when people are watching; it's about who you are when no one is looking. I learned my lesson the hard way, but it was a lesson I'll never forget.

### Descriptive Example: "My Favorite Place"

**Introduction:**
> Nestled at the edge of the village, surrounded by ancient mango trees and singing birds, lies my grandmother's house—my sanctuary and favorite place on earth.

**Body:**
> As you approach, the weathered wooden gate creaks open, announcing your arrival. The pathway, lined with vibrant hibiscus flowers in shades of red and pink, leads to the veranda where my grandmother sits in her rocking chair, a warm smile spreading across her face.
>
> The house itself is small but filled with character. Whitewashed walls bear the marks of time, and the corrugated iron roof tells stories of countless rainy seasons. Inside, the aroma of fresh bread and spiced tea fills the air, mingling with the scent of old books and furniture polish.
>
> The kitchen is the heart of the home. Sunlight streams through the window, illuminating dust motes dancing in the air. Copper pots hang from hooks, their surfaces gleaming. The wooden table, scarred with years of use, stands proudly in the center, bearing witness to countless family meals and conversations.

**Conclusion:**
> This place represents more than just a house; it's a repository of memories, love, and belonging. Here, time moves slowly, allowing me to breathe, reflect, and simply be.

### Expository Example: "How to Study Effectively"

**Introduction:**
> Success in school doesn't depend solely on intelligence—it requires effective study strategies. By implementing proven techniques, any student can improve their academic performance and retain information better.

**Body:**
> **First, create a dedicated study environment.** Choose a quiet space with good lighting, away from distractions like television or social media. Organize your materials so everything you need is within reach. This physical setup signals to your brain that it's time to focus.
>
> **Second, use active learning techniques.** Instead of passively reading textbooks, engage with the material. Take notes in your own words, create mind maps, teach concepts to others, or practice with problems. Active engagement strengthens neural connections and improves retention.
>
> **Finally, implement spaced repetition.** Rather than cramming everything the night before, review material regularly over time. Study for 30-45 minute sessions with short breaks in between. This approach allows your brain to consolidate information and move it to long-term memory.

**Conclusion:**
> Effective studying is a skill that can be learned and perfected. By creating the right environment, actively engaging with material, and spacing out your practice, you'll find that learning becomes easier and more enjoyable.
